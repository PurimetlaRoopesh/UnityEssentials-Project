# Unity Essentials Project

This repository contains my Unity Essentials learning project, where I explored fundamental concepts of game development and interactive systems. The project focuses on building core gameplay mechanics, physics-based interactions, and animated feedback systems using Unity.
This work represents my hands-on practice with Unity as I prepare for advanced studies in XR and interactive technologies.

## Key Features and Implementations

- Player movement and control systems  
- Collision detection and trigger-based interactions  
- Physics-based object behavior using Rigidbody and colliders  
- Basic gameplay mechanics such as item collection and scoring  
- Animation integration for interactive feedback  
- UI elements for displaying game states (score, interactions, etc.)  
- Scene setup and object hierarchy management  
- Asset integration and project structuring following Unity standards

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Unity Editor workflow and scene management  
- C# scripting  
- Physics system integration  
- Animation controllers and transitions  
- GameObject lifecycle and component-based architecture  
- User interaction design and visual feedback  
- Debugging and iteration through playtesting

## Repository Structure

- **Assets** – Game objects, scripts, animations, and media assets  
- **Packages** – Unity package dependencies  
- **ProjectSettings** – Engine and project configuration

## Purpose

This project serves as a foundational step in my journey toward interactive media development. It allowed me to understand how interactive environments are constructed, how users engage with virtual systems, and how gameplay logic is implemented programmatically.
The experience gained here supports my long-term goal building immersive environments, human-centered interactive applications.

Built using Unity as part of my XR / interactive development learning journey.
